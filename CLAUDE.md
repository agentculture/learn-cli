# CLAUDE.md — seed / bootstrap placeholder

## Agent

This repository hosts the **learn-cli** agent.

## Description

A CLI, MCP server, and web front for learning — a hosted site where humans and agents learn a subject step by step. Fronts the french-cli and spanish-cli language tutors, and generalizes to other learnable domains such as leading teams of agents. The learn command is the local operator surface and how agents drive it.

## Re-init instruction

This file is a seed. To expand it into your full runtime prompt:

1. Open this repo in Claude Code (or your preferred AI assistant).
2. Run `/init` — the assistant will read the repo, incorporate the description
   above, and replace this seed with a complete `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Commit the result.

Until you run `/init`, `learn-cli` satisfies the `steward doctor`
`prompt-file-present` and `backend-consistency` invariants (a `CLAUDE.md`
exists and `culture.yaml` declares `backend: claude`) but the prompt is not
yet tailored to this agent's domain.
